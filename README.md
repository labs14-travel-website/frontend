# Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/kBQIxBnm)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Travel-Website-Roamly-app-69b7026b663c4447b6ed95fb5b914fa8)

As envisoned, Roamly is an itinerary builder built for Web and Android. The Web application should allow users to view, favorite, and un-favorite attractions for a destination and then add/remove those attractions to/from their itinerary. The Android counterpart should allow for users to easily view their itinerary on-the-go while they are roamly-ing. 

### Web Key Features
-    Google Login
-    Search Attractions for a Destination
-    View Attractions and Relevant Info
-    Favorite or Un-Favorite Attractions
-    View Favorites in a User Profile

# Tech Stack - Front End

### Front End built using:
- React with Hooks for Framework
- Styled using CSS Modules and SASS Preprocessor
- Continuous Integration using Travis CI
- Analytics using FullStory, Google Analytics, and Heap Analytics
- Error Tracking using Sentry

#### Framework: React with Hooks
- Hooks provided better separation of business logic for long-term maintainability

#### Styling: CSS Modules and SASS
- No library meant more unique/diverse styles
- SASS is built into create-react-app
- CSS Module gives better name-spacing to avoid className conflicts

#### Continuous Integration: Travis CI

Travis CI benefit(s) :
- ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš«

#### Analytics: FullStory, Google Analytics, and Heap Analytics

These provide some benefit(s):
- FullStory has great user interaction tools and statistics as well as easy to use UI
- Heap Analytics similar to FullStory for extra coverage
- Google Analytics works well with Google Login

#### Error Tracking: Sentry
- ðŸš«

#### Front End deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

# Tech Stack - Back End

### [Back End](https://github.com/labs14-travel-website/backend) built using:
- Framework as PostgreSQL
- Query Builder using Knex
- Data Access using GraphQL

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server

- Unit Testing using Jest and Enzyme
- End to End Testing using Cypress

#### Unit Testing: Jest and Enzyme
- Jest and React was made by same group
- Jest offers powerful assertion tools
- Enzyme offers powerful mounting and selector tools

#### End to End Testing: Cypress
- Excellent documentation and well supported
- Stubbing is excelling tool for testing state

# Installation Instructions

ðŸš«explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

ðŸš«replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
